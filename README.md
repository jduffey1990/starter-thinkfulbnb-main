# Thinkfulbnb

Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. Thinkfulbnb hosts rent out different kinds of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles.

For this assignment, we impletmented Thinkfulbnb's landing page in HTML & CSS.

The UX designer provided me with the following user interface mockups to compare to my final product.  They are not exactly the same, but we have a functioning website for both mobile and desktop view as seen in dev tools:
